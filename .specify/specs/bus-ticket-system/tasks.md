# Tasks: Bus Ticket Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/bus-ticket-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Include unit tests for models/services, integration tests for user journeys, contract tests for APIs.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Laravel App**: `app/Http/Controllers/`, `app/Models/`, `resources/views/`, `public/assets/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume Laravel project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan (app/, resources/, tests/, etc.)
- [ ] T002 Initialize Laravel project with required dependencies (Google Maps API, Stripe, etc.)

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations for core entities (Users, Roles, Stations, Routes, DriverApplications, Subscriptions)
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement RBAC middleware and policies for role-based access
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure in Laravel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before controllers
- Controllers before views
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for driver registration API in tests/Feature/DriverRegistrationTest.php"
Task: "Integration test for approval process in tests/Feature/DriverApprovalTest.php"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create DriverApplication model in app/Models/DriverApplication.php"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
    - Developer A: User Story 1 (Driver Registration)
    - Developer B: User Story 2 (Route Management)
    - Developer C: User Story 3 (Ticket Booking)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
